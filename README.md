# Felice
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/heetch/felice.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/heetch/felice)
## What is Felice?
Felice is a nascent, opinionated Kafka library for Go, in Go. 

## Can I use Felice?
Felice is very much a work in progress.  We expect to move forward quickly, but it's not ready to use in anger yet.

## Why "Felice"?
Felice Bauer was, at one time, Franz Kafka's fiance.  He wrote her many messages, which she faithfuly kept, and later published.

## Where should I start?
If you wish to send messages via Kafka, you should start by reading
the documentation for the `producer` package.  If you wish to consume
messages from Kafka, you should start by reading the documentation for
the `consumer` package.  The `message` package contains the `Message` type that is
shared by both `consumer` and `producer` code.
